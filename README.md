# üé≠ Ryzor

A universal Roblox script hub built with Rayfield UI that dynamically loads scripts from this repository.

## üöÄ Quick Start with Ryzor Hub

Execute this in your favorite Roblox executor:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Its3rr0rsWRLD/Ryzor/main/source.lua'))()
```

> **Note:** This is the hub, not the miscellaneous scripts. The hub automatically detects the game you're playing and loads the appropriate scripts. Miscellaneous scripts can be found in the [scripts](https://github.com/Its3rr0rsWRLD/Ryzor/tree/main/scripts/misc/README.md) folder.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Script Loading** - Automatically scans the repository for available game scripts
- **Modern UI** - Clean Rayfield interface with organized tabs and categories  
- **Game Detection** - Shows scripts available for your current game
- **Universal Tools** - Anti-AFK and other cross-game utilities

- Pyramid Eaters (19005776777) 
- Eat Pizza Simulator (16426855766)
- And more...

*Scripts are added regularly - the hub will show newly supported games automatically*
